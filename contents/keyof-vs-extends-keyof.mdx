One of the coolest features of TypeScript is the ability to limit the keys of an object to a specific subset of values using the `keyof` operator.

However, there are two similar-looking syntaxes for this operation that can be confusing for us: `K extends keyof T` and `K keyof T`. In this post, we'll explore the differences between these two syntaxes and when to use each one. Let's dive in!

## `K keyof T`

The syntax `K keyof T` is a way to ensure that `K` is a key of the type `T`. It's an easy way to limit the type of a variable to a particular set of keys. For instance, let's take a look at the following code:

```ts
interface Product {
    color: string;
    name: string;
    size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'extraLarge';
    weight: number;
}

const getProperty = (item: Product, key: keyof Product): string | number => {
    return item[key];
};

const item: Product = {
    color: 'white',
    name: 'T-Shirt',
    size: 'medium',
    weight: 200,
};
getProperty(item, 'color');     // `white`
getProperty(item, 'size');      // `medium`

// Argument of type '"length"' is not assignable
// to parameter of type 'keyof Product'.
getProperty(item, 'length'));
```

In this example, we have a function called `getProperty` that takes in an object of type `Product` and a key of type `keyof Product`. This means that the `key` parameter can only be set to `color`, `name`, `size` or `weight`, which are the only valid keys of the `Product` interface.

The cool thing is that TypeScript will give us an error at compile-time if we try to pass in an invalid key like `length`. This helps us catch errors early on and prevent bugs from popping up in our code.

## `K extends keyof T`

The `K extends keyof T` syntax indicates that `K` must be a valid key of the `T` type. This syntax comes in handy when we need to accept multiple keys as input to a function or define a type that can have one of several key-value pairs. We can even use a union of keys with this syntax.

Let's take another look at the example we discussed earlier, but this time, let's leverage the benefits of this syntax.

```ts
interface Product {
    color: string;
    name: string;
    size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'extraLarge';
    weight: number;
}

const getProperty = <K extends keyof Product>(item: Product, keys: K[]): Product[K][] => {
    return keys.map(key => item[key]);
};

const item: Product = {
    color: 'white',
    name: 'T-Shirt',
    size: 'medium',
    weight: 200,
};

getProperty(item, ['color']);           // [`white`]
getProperty(item, ['size']);            // [`medium`]
getProperty(item, ['color', 'size']);   // [`white`, `medium`]

// Error: Type '"length"' is not assignable
// to type 'keyof Product'.
getProperty(item, ['length']));
```

In this example, we have a function called `getProperty`. It takes in an object of type `Person` and an array of keys, which can only be either `color`, `name`, `size` or `weight`. TypeScript makes sure we can't pass in any other keys.

## In conclusion

To sum up, `K keyof T` specifies that `K` must be a single key of the type `T`, while `K extends keyof T` specifies that `K` must be a union of keys of the type `T`. Use `K keyof T` when you need to specify a single key, and use `K extends keyof T` when you need to allow multiple keys.
