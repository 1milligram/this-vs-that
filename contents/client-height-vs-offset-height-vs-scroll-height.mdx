`clientHeight` = the height of an element + the vertical padding.

`offsetHeight` = the height of the element + the vertical padding + the top and bottom borders + the horizontal scrollbar (if it's available).

`scrollHeight` = the height of element's content (including the content which isn't visible on the screen) + the vertical padding.
