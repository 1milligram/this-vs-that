---

TypeScript has two types, `never` and `void`, which represent the absence of a value. While they may seem similar, it's important to know the key differences between them. Let's dive in and explore!

## void

The `void` type represents the absence of a value. It's typically used as the return type for functions that don't return a value.

```ts log.ts
const log = (message: string): void {
    console.log(message);
};
```

In the example above, the `log` function doesn't give back any value, which means that its return type is `void`.

## never

The `never` type represents the absence of a value that will never occur. It's handy in two scenarios:

-   When a function always throws an error.

In the following example, the `throwError` function will always throw an error and never return a value.

```ts throwError.ts
const throwError = (): never => {
    throw new Error('Something went wrong');
};
```

-   When a function never finishes.

The code inside the `infiniteLoop` function never finishes executing because it contains an endless loop.

```ts infiniteLoop.ts
const infiniteLoop = (): never => {
    while (true) {
        // Do something indefinitely ...
    }
};
```

## Differences

When it comes to `void` and `never`, it's important to understand their distinctions. `void` represents the absence of a value that could happen, while `never` represents the absence of a value that will never happen.

To put it simply, `void` is used when a function may or may not return a value, while `never` is used when a function will never return a value.
