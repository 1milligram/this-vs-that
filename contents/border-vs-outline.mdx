## Differences

1. Outlines don't take up space meaning that using outlines or not doesn't affect the dimensions of the outlined element.

2. `border` supports rounded corners with the `border-radius` property, meanwhile `outline` doesn't.

3. We can define the border style for each side via the `border-top`, `border-left`, `border-bottom` and `border-right` properties.
   It's not possible to set the style for a particular side with `outline`.

4. The outlines may be non-rectangular.

    In the sample code below, the outlines are shown in a non-rectangular shape:

    ```html
    <div>
        ...
        <span style="outline: 0.25rem solid blue"> ... </span>
        ...
    </div>
    ```

## Good practice

The primary purpose of `outline` is to support accessibility. It provides visual feedback for links, buttons when users navigate between them with the _Tab_ key.

You shouldn't remove outline style from elements when they are being focused. Setting `outline: none` or `outline: 0` will make the page inaccessible for the people who don't use mouse or have a visual impairment.

One of the first and popular CSS reset library [removed](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset200802.css) the outline, but the author leaves a comment that reminds us to define the focus styles:

```css
/* remember to define focus styles! */
:focus {
    outline: 0;
}
```

But this reset was removed in the [latest version](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css).

If you have to remove the outline style, then it's recommended to provide alternative styles.
Here are some pure CSS based solutions:

-   Set the background color

    ```css
    a:focus {
        background: ...;
    }
    ```

-   Set the text color:

    ```css
    a:focus {
        color: ...;
    }
    ```

-   Using both approaches

    ```css
    a:focus {
        background: ...;
        color: ...;
    }
    ```

-   Use a different style to normalize the look and feel of outline across browsers such as

    ```css
    a:focus {
        outline: thin dotted;
    }
    ```

There's another approach which uses JavaScript to handle the events. If we detect there is a mouse event, then remove the outline style.
In the other case, if a keyboard event is detected then we restore the outline style.

Here is a piece of code demonstrating this idea:

```js
// Append a custom style to `head`
const style = document.createElement('style');
document.head.appendChild(style);

const remove = () => (style.innerHTML = ':focus { outline: 0 }');
const restore = () => (style.innerHTML = '');

// Remove the outline initially
remove();

document.addEventListener('mousedown', () => restore());
document.addEventListener('keydown', () => remove());
```

Some other websites such as [Github](https://github.com) use a similar approach. Starting with a CSS class that resets the outline property:

```css
.intent-mouse a:focus {
    outline: 0;
}
```

Initially, the CSS class is added to the body element:

```html
<body class="intent-mouse">
    ...
</body>
```

By detecting the keyboard and mouse events, we can remove the class or add it back to the body element:

```js
document.addEventListener('mousedown', () => {
    document.body.classList.add('intent-mouse');
});

document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
    // If users press the Tab key
    // then we assume that they intent to use the keyboard to navigate
    if (e.key === 'Tab') {
        document.body.classList.remove('intent-mouse');
    }
});
```

## Tip

The `outline` property is useful when you want to visualize elements on the page.
In the following sample code, we [iterate](https://phuoc.ng/collection/html-dom/loop-over-a-nodelist) over all the elements and
[set](https://phuoc.ng/collection/html-dom/set-css-style-for-an-element) the `outline` property with a [random hex color](https://phuoc.ng/collection/1-loc/random/generate-a-random-hex-color):

```js
[].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('*'), (ele) => {
    const color = `#\${Math.random().toString(16).slice(2, 8).padEnd(6, '0')}`;
    ele.style.outline = `1px solid \${color}`;
});
```

Of course, you will need an opposite command to [reset](https://phuoc.ng/collection/html-dom/set-css-style-for-an-element) the `outline` property:

```js
[].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('*'), (ele) => ele.style.removeProperty('outline'));
```

You can change the selector from `*` to whatever you want to match the set of particular elements, for example:

```js
// Set the outline for links only
[].forEach.call(
    document.querySelectorAll('a'),
    ...
);
```
